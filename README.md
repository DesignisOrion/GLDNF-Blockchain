# GLDNF BlockChain

Created a GLDNF Blockchain with a gldnf coin in which can be mined. Goal was to get a deeper insight of the blockchain development and cryptocurrency. For this blockchain I was able to review how to create the genesis block, obtaining the latest block, adding new blocks and testing the blockchain. 

## Terminology

index - Unique number that tracks the position of every block in the entire blockchain.

timestamp - A record of teh time of occurence of each completed transaction.

data - provides data about the completed transactions, such as the sender details, recipient's details and quanitity of transaction.

precedingHash - points to the hash of the preceding block in the blockchain. This is important in maintaining the blockchain integrity.
